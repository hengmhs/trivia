# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Project 2

## Trivia Game

For Project 2, we created a Trivia Game. Users must register an account to play the game. Once registered, users can sign in and join a Game Room to play against other users. Users play for 10 rounds and have 60 seconds to answer each question. The user with the highest score at the end wins!
